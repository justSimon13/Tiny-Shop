                TinyStore Coffee was founded by two lifelong baristas with a single goal:
                to make world-class coffee accessible to everyone. What began as a local coffee pop-up turned into an online destination for premium beans and pro-level gear.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                We believe that every great cup starts with quality – whether it's the beans, the grind, or the gear. That's why we personally test every product and roast we offer.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Our mission is simple: empower coffee lovers to brew better and connect deeper – one cup at a time.
